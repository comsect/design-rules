### Exercise of discretionary power of Controller, miscellaneous power of Controller

The time within which a person entitled under section 33 of the Act, to an opportunity of being heard shall exercise his option of requiring to be heard shall be one month from the date of a notice which the Controller shall give to such person or his agent before determining the matter with reference to which such person is entitled to be heard. If within that month such person or his agent requires to be heard, the Controller shall appoint a date for the hearing and shall give ten days notice thereof: </p> Provided that if the giving of ten dayâ€™s notice would cause an application for the registration of design to be deemed to have been abandoned before the hearing, the Controller may curtail the period of notice.
